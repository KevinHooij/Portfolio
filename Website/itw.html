        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>Into the Woods is a 3D VR horror game developed for FR&T during my minor Virtual Reality at the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences.
            The player finds themselves alone in the woods after a camping trip with their friends.
            It is up to them to fight resources to make it through the night and keep evil at bay.</p>
        <p>For this project we wanted to enhance the user's feeling of presence while playing our game.
            Therefore, as an extra way to give feedback, we created a fan rig than can be attached to your VR headset.
            This fan rig can then do various things, like give small puffs of air to make it feel like a monster is breathing down your neck,
            or create a flow of wind to create a colder atmosphere when the player reaches certain areas.</p>
        <p>All of the assets for this project, with the exception of character models and sound effects, have been
            created by my team and myself. The fan rig can be controlled through an Arduino, for which we used a package
            from the Unity Asset Store.

            The game can be downloaded through the button below.
