        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>Function Dungeon is an educational game where the player has to find their way through
            a variety of dungeons while solving math problems to continue.
        </p>
        <p>Function Dungeon was developed for The Science and Mathematics Education research group.
            They are researching how games can best be used to help pupils understand math in their education.
            I provided them with prototypes and concepts based on existing literature on how children learn
            and retain information. Combining this aspect with game design made for a fun and interesting challenge.
        </p>
        <p> For Function Dungeon the concept and design were created by myself. I was also responsible for all of the programming.
            Assets were created partially by myself and by a third party.
