        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>Conquering the Galaxy 2 is a 2D, Top-Down, Space Shooter game.
            The player fights their way through a series of levels and fights
            a variety of bosses. All levels can be played individually after
            they have been unlocked. However, beating multiple levels in a row
            is likely to get you a higher score.</p>
        <p>Conquering the Galaxy 2 was developed as a personal project.
        The original Conquering the Galaxy was the first game I ever developed.
        Therefore, I thought it'd be fun to see how I would make the game again with more experience under my belt.</p>
        <p>While all of the programming in this game has been done by myself, I did receive a lot of help from my friends.
            They provided a lot of assets including sprites, backgrounds, original music and even their voice.
            This project would not have turned out as it did without them.
