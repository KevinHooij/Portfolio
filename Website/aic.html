        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>Awesome Island Challenge is a Top-Down, 2D, online multiplayer game where the players go
            through a series of minigames until one contestant remains as the winner. After a minigame
            the winner may automatically proceed through the next round. Then all players will have to
            vote for a player who will be voted out of the game. A player who has been voted out isn't done just yet though.
            While they will no longer be able to win they can work against, or assist other players in the next round.</p>
        <p>Awesome Island Challenge was developed as a personal project. The entire project was made in the summer of 2021. The idea was based on TV show games like "Survivor".
            Instead of having players be fully eliminated though, I wanted to work with the idea of keeping them in the game with a different role.
            The game was developed in the Unity Game Engine with Photon PUN 2</p>
        <p>The concept and minigames were all created and designed by myself. I have also done all the programmign within this project.
            All of the assets in this project, like art and music, are original and have been provided by my talented friends.
